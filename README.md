# COMP-562-Final-Project

Running the program: 

- Make sure all .py files are in the same directory 
- Navigate to the directory in the terminal run the command "python main.py"
- You will be prompted to enter the directory of the letter.data file
- A visual image of each letter along with its associated metadata (including pixel matrix) will display. Press space to move on to the    next letter in the sequence. Press escape to exit the sequence
- The program will run and display the result of various iterations of the feed-forward multilayer neural net

******* If the program does not run correctly, it is likely due to an error with the input function in main.py when prompting for the file path. To fix this, please try using raw_input instead and if that does not work please hardcode the file path *****
